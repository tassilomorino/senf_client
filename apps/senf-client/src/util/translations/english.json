  "faq_question2": "What happens to the ideas?",
  "faq_answer2": "The ideas received are submitted to the city administration by the urban planners:inside from our team, through which we have entered into a constructive dialogue with the administration on how the ideas can be implemented in the processes. As an interface between the citizens and the city administration, we bring the results of the applications to the public via Instagram. The first requests have already been included in the planning. For example, one of the most popular streets in Cologne, Zülpicher Straße, is to become car-free in a central section.\n\n It is particularly pleasing to see that our publications of feedback from the respective offices via our Instagram channel are also welcomed by users, even if with negative results. On the part of the Bürger:innen and the administration, it has already been expressed that we are using Senf.koeln to ensure greater understanding and closer partnership and transparent communication on both sides.",
  "faq_question3": "Who is behind Senf.koeln?",
  "faq_answer3": "Behind Senf.koeln is a young, interdisciplinary team of seven city makers who, out of intrinsic motivation, want to activate fellow citizens to help shape their own urban space and express ideas for improvement and redesign. Wir bringen unterschiedliche Expertisen aus den Bereichen Stadtentwicklung- und Planung, Design, UX/UI-Design, Mediengestaltung, Kommunikation und Programmierung mit. Durch die interdisziplinäre Kombination unserer Kompetenzen ergänzen wir uns als Team und können gezielt zusammenwirken und einander unterstützen.",
  "faq_question4": "What is your vision?",
  "faq_answer4": "Our goal is to contribute to a demand-driven development of cities and municipalities. The focus on a digital participation platform arose from the frustration about the lack of low-threshold, comprehensible and contemporary participation opportunities in urban planning. We want to contribute to a lively and constructive exchange between citizens, the administration and active organizations. Since we believe that citizens have a basic right to participate in the design of their living space, but that there is a lack of opportunities to express needs and to get involved on their own initiative or on a project basis, we have developed Senf.koeln.\n\nAn open, digitally supported participation process can improve the dialog between different urban development actors and at the same time promote engagement among the population and reduce frustration. Thus, an intelligent smart city interface between the city and stakeholders should be created to ensure responsiveness. Our experience is that urban design benefits manifold from stronger, more interactive and transparent citizen:inside participation. We are convinced that we can make an important contribution to the democratic processes of society with our web app.",

  "faq_answer5": "",
  "faq_question6": "Do you work with the city government?",
  "faq_answer6": "",

  "faq_question7": "Do you want to expand to other cities?",
  "faq_answer7": "You should be able to contribute with your ideas in every city. We are convinced of that! We are using all our capacities for the implementation and are currently focusing on Cologne in order to gain important experience on this basis. In the process, we are also developing strategies for expansion in order to implement the platform beyond the borders of Cologne. With this goal in mind, we are currently working on technical scalability. At the same time, we are optimizing the design and functionality in a continuous process to make it as attractive and intuitive to use as possible. Through constant exchange and initial joint projects with various stakeholders, we are iteratively improving the platform in order to adapt it to the needs of citizen participation of the future and to develop new opportunities for participation. In the process, we are designing and testing additional features, such as surveys and 3D tools. Our goal is to create a platform for everyone - for municipal employees, who can handle their processes on the platform - for planning offices, who can design their projects more demand-oriented through the digital component - for associations and initiatives, who long for tools for bottom-up participation - and of course for citizens, who can jointly develop their ideas for the urban space through the toolset of the platform.",
  "faq_question8": "Are you looking for reinforcement in the team? How do you work together?",
  "faq_answer8": "We are always looking for motivated reinforcements for our team and are open for a conversation! Feel free to get in touch with us - no matter what area you come from! In our team, everyone contributes according to their capacities. We exchange a lot among ourselves and support each other. Since we work on many different areas, we usually act very independently and avoid large agreements in a gathered group. We communicate via Slack, because we work remotely for the most part. Of course, we also like to see each other face-to-face, so we've rented workspaces in the co-working space in Cologne's Südstadt district, where some of us work."
